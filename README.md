# Barnes & Noble SQL + R Database Project

## Project Title:  
**Barnes & Noble Backend Database System**

## Description:  
This project simulates the backend relational database system for Barnes & Noble, a leading bookstore chain. It handles data operations for customers, orders, payments, books, and authors. The project focuses on database design, SQL-based querying, and integration with R for analytical purposes.

## Key Features:
- SQL database designed and queried using DBeaver
- ER Diagram and Relational Schema created using ERDPlus
- Complex SQL queries with `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `SUM`, and `COUNT`
- R code used to connect to SQL server and perform queries
- Created SQL `VIEW` to analyze bestselling books

## Files:
- `annotated-Barnes and nobles- DB_FINAL PROJECT.pdf` — Full project report with SQL queries, ER diagram, schema, and explanations  
- `analysis.R` — R script for connecting to the database and running analytics  
- `Barnes_and_Noble_ERD.png` — ER Diagram from ERDPlus  
- `Relational_Schema_BN.png` — Relational Schema diagram  

## Requirements:
- SQL Server (used with DBeaver)
- ERDPlus (for diagrams)
- R 4.x  
- R packages: `DBI`, `odbc`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2` (if needed)

## Results:
- Summarized total customer spending, bestselling books, and sales insights using SQL queries
- Created a SQL `VIEW` named `project_Top3_BestSellingBooks` to highlight the top 3 revenue-generating titles
- R integration enabled further querying and data visualization opportunities

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how a structured database and SQL logic can support key bookstore operations. Using DBeaver for SQL and R for analysis adds analytical depth, making the system suitable for scalable retail operations.
